The difference to the previous releases of 2.09, 2.10, 2.11
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Printing to a string improved by introducing the class  DShow.
2. The functions  discriminant_1 and discriminant_1_euc  are introduced
   for univariate polynomials. 
3. solveCubic and solveQuartic  methods are added
                                (see comments in the source).
3. A couple of minor bug fixes done in installation and in porting to 
   GHC-7.8.2.

DoCon is
--------
a  Computer Algebra  program written in a  
purely functional, non-strict language     Haskell.

It joins the   categorial approach   to the mathematical computation 
expressed via the Haskell type classes,  and explicit processing  of 
the domain description terms.

Categorial approach  means that
-------------------------------
arithmetic and some other operations are defined under the very
generic assumptions: "over any Euclidean ring", over any field,
and so on,
the Domain Constructors are supported: 
                     Fraction, Polynomial, Residue ring, and others,
that is certain set of operations are defined automatically, 
following the domain constructors. 

Abilities 
---------
(mostly, commutative algebra)
Mathematical library: 
* Operations with permutations
* Linear algebra over an Euclidean domain:  reduction to the 
  staircase and diagonal forms of matrix, solving a system,
* Operations with fractions over a ring with GCD,
* Polynomial arithmetic in  R[x1...xn],  R a commutative ring, 
  various kinds of polynomial representation
  (univariate, multivariate, "recursive" form ...)
* g.c.d  in  R[x1...xn],  R  a factorial ring
* Factorization of bivariate polynomial over any finite field  k, 
  building finite extension of  k  for the given dimension,
  Hensel lift in R[x], for an Euclidean ring R.
* Groebner basis  and  syzygy generators  in a free module over
  R[x1...xn],  R  an Euclidean ring;
* Some support for non-commutative polynomials over a commutative
  ring;
* Symmetric function package;

Category hierarchy expressed partially via the data classes:
* Set, Semigroup, Group, Ring, LinSolvRing ... LeftModule ...
* operations with the description terms of  Subset, Subgroup, 
  Subring, Ideal ...

Domain constructors:
* Permutation
* Fraction field for a gcd-ring
* Direct product of Sets, (semi)Groups, Rings,
  Free (vector) module over a ring
* Matrix algebra over a commutative ring
* Polynomial algebra over a commutative ring: UPol, Pol, RPol models
* Vector module over a ring P, maybe, with Groebner bases structure
* Residue ring by the ideal:  ResidueI, ResidueE  models for the
  generic and Euclidean case.

Property processing:
* evaluation of certain small set of the most important algebraic 
  property values is supported, such as 
  Finite, IsCyclicGroup, IsMaximalIdeal, and others.

On Haskell language
-------------------
For the  Haskell language  materials, and its implementation systems 
see the place 
                 http://www.haskell.org

Used language extension
-----------------------
DoCon is a program package written in what we call 
Haskell-2-pre  - certain functional extension of  Haskell-2010.
Haskell-2-pre   includes the   multiparametric classes,  overlapping
instances, other minor features (see the part `extensions' in the 
docon.cabal  file in the source).

Used extra libraries (beyond Haskell-2010)
--------------------
Set.Set, Map.Map                -- of GHC,
System.Random version 1.0.1.1  
       -- a separate from GHC library (written in Haskell) residing on
          http://hackage.haskell.org/package/random 
          (first, install GHC, then use ghc to install the `random' 
           package).
       Re-build Random under each new GHC version.
   
Ports:    
------    
DoCon-2.12 has been tested under  ghc-7.8.2 + Linux,

Reports about possible later ports is in the current notes in the 
distribution:  
              docon/notes/2.12.txt

WARNING:  usually, each DoCon version works (literally as it is)
          only under a single GHC version.

On the other hand, it is easy to port to other GHC versions.
We believe, it can be ported to other Haskell implementations. 
The difficulty may be, for example, in different treating of 
overlapping instances in Haskell implementations.

Machines, environment
---------------------
DoCon  has to work everywhere where the aforementioned Haskell 
language implementations work -- many machines and systems. 
To install DoCon  on your particular machine, find the GHC 
system at  http://haskell.org/ghc  and install it as it is explained 
there. Then, follow the document  install.txt  of DoCon distribution.

Analogues
---------
(Aldor-)Axiom, MuPAD.
Difference:  
DoCon is purely functional (avoids side effects),  
relies on `lazy' evaluation, is written in Haskell only, 
distributes freely with source.
It uses the so-called sample argument approach to replace the 
dependent types tool of Aldor language.
DoCon  has a smaller library of methods 
(no limits, no differential algebra, no integration ...).

Documentation
-------------
Everything is explained in the file  docon/manual.ps  contained in 
the archive. But first, look into the paper and manuscripts
            "Computer algebra with Haskell ...",
            "Haskell and computer algebra",
            "What should be an universal functional lalnguage",
residing at
            http://www.botik.ru/~mechvel/papers.html

to get author's idea about relation of Haskell to computer algebra. 

* Particular points: the Manual 
  * explains the relation of DoCon to Aldor language and 
    Axiom system, 
  * gives the performance tests for comparison to popular Axiom and
    MuPAD computer algebra programs 
    (`strict' and non-functional systems). 

Demonstration, test, benchmark
------------------------------
install.txt  explains how to run the large automatic test.
Selecting different parts in the test function result data  presents
also the demonstration examples or benchmarks.

Current notes
-------------
such as known bugs and their work-arounds, are contained in the 
current notes in the distribuition:
                                      docon/notes/2.12.txt
-- the contents of this file updates.
